# Smart Contract: Mitigate Exam Cheating


## 📌 Project Description
This blockchain-based project provides a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof way to record and verify exam submissions. By storing hashed exam answers on the blockchain, the system ensures that no student can alter their response after submission, and educators can independently verify the authenticity of submitted exams.


## 🎯 Project Vision
To create a trustable, decentralized exam integrity system that eliminates cheating, ensures transparency, and modernizes digital examinations through blockchain technology.


## ⭐ Key Features
- **Tamper‑proof Exam Submission:** Stores hashed exam answers to prevent post‑submission manipulation.
- **Exam Verification Mechanism:** Enables educators to verify the authenticity of the submitted exam.
- **Decentralized & Trustless:** Removes dependency on a single authority.
- **Secure Data Handling:** Uses cryptographic hashing for exam records.


## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integration with decentralized identity (DID) systems.
- Adding time‑locked submissions.
- Blockchain‑based automatic grading.
- Frontend dashboard for students and evaluators.
- Integration with IPFS for full exam storage.
